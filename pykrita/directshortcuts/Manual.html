<h3> Direct Shortcuts Krita Extension</h3>
<p>This script adds options to the shortcuts menu for setting the active brush opacity to a fixed value rather than "up" or "down" from the current value.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The default shortcut is ctrl+alt+shift+[number key] to set the opacity to [number key*10] percent. </p>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+1 = 10%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+2 = 20%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+3 = 30%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+4 = 40%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+5 = 50%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+6 = 60%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+7 = 70%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+8 = 80%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+9 = 90%</li>
<li>ctrl+alt+shift+0 = 100%</li>

<p>The intended use is to program these shortcuts to a macro keyboard, and have easy one-press access to the target opacity, without needing to consider the current state of the brush. Alternatively, pick a few that you use often and assign them a more useable shortcut.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>In krita, go to Settings> Manage Resources > Open Resource Folder.</p>
<p>If you have an "actions" folder, copy the contents of the downloaded "actions" folder to there. If not, copy the downloaded "actions" folder to your resources folder.</p>
<p>If you have a "pykrita" folder in your resources folder, copy the contents of the downloaded "pykrita" folder to there. If not, copy the downloaded "pykrita" folder to your resources folder.</p>
<p>Restart krita. "setopacity" options should now appear under Tools>Scripts and under Settings>Configure Krita>Keyboard Shortcuts>Scripts>DirectShortcuts.</p>
